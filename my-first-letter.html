      <p style="text-align: center; font-size: 1.5em;"><strong>squandering time at milano</strong></p>

      <p>sitting at a wooden table typing away a string of words, i noticed an elderly man at 
    the perfect age of 84 slide his right hand across the table toward me. it was his invitation to a conversation.</p>
     
    <img src="https://i.pinimg.com/736x/a4/43/9e/a4439ee876a470520f1aeb3ee62e5e33.jpg" alt="description" style="width: 250px; border: 5px solid rgb(33, 105, 8); margin-top: 25px; float: right; margin-left: 20px;">

<p>"hello," his low-toned tremor began, "i have the bad habit of telling people what i'm reading. may i tell you what i'm reading?"</p>

<p>he didn't know it, but he and i share the same mannerism of cautioning others: "i have the bad habit of..." 
    so i accepted his invitation to a conversation. he wore a plain navy blue baseball cap, rimless glasses,
    a quarter-zip that was olive green, and a well-worn gold engagement ring. on the table in front of him were three black books 
    scattered here and there, between his forearms lay a pocket journal propped open, and two pens--one black, one red--resting nearby. 
    as i looked at  him, he pressed his lips then released the first urgent entreaty, slowly and methodically. </p>

      <p>"write your novels. write."</p> 

        <p>no kidding.</p>
    
      <p>the well-lived man's name is jacques depelchin. he was born in 1942 to a french man 
        and a congolese woman. his native tongue is french. english is just one of the many languages he knows. in his 
        adolescence he was taught greek and latin to be well-read in the classics. </p>
     

        <p>"learn more languages. they open you up to more knowledge."</p>

        <p>in 1962 he was 20. in 1968, while studying economics in london, he met his wife--he was 26. 
        for a brief time as a middle-aged man, he was a teacher in egypt and mamdani's father was his pupil.</p>
        
        <p>during this conversation about writers and readings and pupils and their masters, the anecdotes that
         followed each twist and turn were small fragments of his life that happened to connect. it was evident
          that all his life he had been enmeshed in the world of academia, and he was part of a dying breed. 
          after 1999, the modern mind has been too doped out on dopamine. the endless scrolling, e-cigs, fast fashion, 
          fast food, fast pleasure (porn addiction), loss of originality, loss of personality, and loss of manners have 
          sullied humanity and future generations. </p>

        <p>anyway, at some point in the conversation he wrote his first recommendation to me and tore out the page for me 
            to keep. but for the entire conversation, the paper belonged to both of us. every few minutes
             he gently took back the 3x4 lined paper and scribbled more. it inevitably became a to-do list.</p>

</p>




<p style="text-align: center; font-size: 14px; margin-top: 5px;">[ you can see he attached his email and his published work: <i>silences in african history</i>. ]</p>

        <p>then, he loaded his words like red shells and fired beseechingly, aiming at my soul: "write a book about today's politics." 
            furrowing a brow, "do you know what china is doing? they're conducting reforestation!"</p>

            <p>going into detail about the times, it is evident that his pleas for the youth to write
                a book about current affairs are due to his belief that humanity will cease to be 'cuz of capitalism,
                 fascism, and unethical advancements in technology. in that exact order. 
                 he emphatically believes the only way to preserve knowledge and humanity is through writing.</p>

      <p>"earth will end up like mars if we continue down this path."</p>
      <p>"not many people believe fascism is tied to capitalism."</p>

      <p>sadly, i am not a savant with political drivel, and although most people with basic awareness 
        already know about the correlation between fascism and capitalism, i am simply a redscarepod faggot. 
        i did not have the heart to break such a thing to him. also, the fact that i'm retarded. </p>

        <p>to put it then, the conversation was essentially a supplication for the youth to not stop writing and staying aware of the times.
            i thanked him for the invitation to converse. he then <i>thanked me</i> for accepting it. standing to his feet, gathering his books, 
            pocket journal, and pens, he paused before leaving. he looked at me as if he were zeus and i were atlas, and he spoke his commandment that 
            weighed heavily as the world itself:</p>

        <p>"write your books."</p>

            <p>now, I am condemned to the task. carrying it over my frail back for eternity. 
                jacob, you are my first reader and it seems you will be my first everything. 
                hold my hand tight, don't let go. we're 'bout to go through hell.</p>

        <p style= color:fuchsia>this story takes place sometime in october, about a boy and a girl in the 21st century, woefully far from biblical times. there is no definite proof
             that god is real or unreal. the only thing that keeps him alive to most believers is faith and trust. incidentally, the same foundation to all relationships: 
             faith and trust.</p>
        
  <p style= color:fuchsia> as it goes, the boy seemed to be aware of something before the girl. he already knew something she did not. was this unfair? no. god had ordained man to be superior 
        to woman. after all, isn't that the punishment women have to endure since eve disobeyed god? yet, despite the boy recognizing attraction first, it was still 
        the girl who initiated the whole thing. it was she who had invited the young man to go on walks with her at night.</p>

    <p style= color:fuchsia> from there they grew more acquainted, and with no warning at all, the month of october was no longer an emblem of black cats and fallen leaves, but a month belonging 
        to a black-haired boy with green eyes. for that time she felt god had ordained her as superior to the opposite sex. she was in control with the invitations she brought forth to the boy. 
        she took pleasure in steering the rudder of their fates. she was attempting to sail their relationship into the waters.</p>

    <p style= color:fuchsia>there was one walk in particular where the boy unpromptedly said he was not a virgin. he didn't know it, but he had caused her ship's mainsail to collapse. she lost control 
        of the rudder temporarily. for that brief moment she was lost at sea.</p>

    <p style= color:fuchsia>as the words bled from his mouth he looked over to the girl. slowly the girl continued behind him. she did not look at him. instead, she watched him from her peripheral vision. she 
        had guessed the boy was possibly trying to gauge if she had any feelings for him, and maybe his way of doing this was by metioning previous flings. or maybe he wanted to 
        impress her with possible experience. or maybe there was no reason at all why he mentioned such a thing. the guess wouldn't matter anyway. no one can read minds to be 100% 
        sure of anything. you can only rely on confessions, and even then you have to force yourself to <i>trust</i> that the confession is true.</p>

    <img src="../images/knuckle.jpg" alt="description" style="width: 250px; border: 5px solid rgb(255, 0, 183); margin-top: 25px; margin-right:20px; float: left; margin-left: 20px;">

    <p style= color:fuchsia>still on that same walk, the girl had tried fishing for more details about the mysterious one-night stand. the only thing he could mutter was "horrible" and "evil" and "bad!" hearing the lack 
        of detail and juvenile words to describe such a pivotal night for what makes a boy to a man, she knew there was a fib lingering around. 
        feeling satisfied, the mainsail was able to stand again, catch wind again, and incrementally propel the ship forward again.</p>

   <p style= color:fuchsia>it was only his dishonesty that drew the girl more to him. not because of being <i>dishonest</i>, but because of the human tendency to feel shame that made him <i>want</i> to be dishonest. he wanted to feel 
        worthy. so it seemed. and he wanted her to view him as worthy. as it seemed. but in his want she recognized his deprivation. essentially, to her, his meekness was his virtue. she knew then in October he was a virgin, and 
        she was reminded of it again on january 10th when, after she kissed him for the first time, he confessed with timidity that he was nervous.</p>

    <p style= color:fuchsia>now, in february the young boy and the girl are inseparable. on a tuesday night, among the silent hall of a house they share with others, the two were making a scene like children. the boy 
        played with the girl as if she were a doll. he propped her head out the door, moved here body around the empty space of the hall, pinioned her to the ground and the wall in good faith, and whispered 
        playful teases to make her laugh. truly, it's a bloody shame no one had witnessed them, they could have been the passerby's adam and eve for that brief moment.</p>
    
    <p style= color:fuchsia>once they got to their feet she looked at him. with no hesitation, she asked if he could take her virginity. they walked back into his room, hand in hand, shut the door, turned out
         the light, and undressed. that night there was no penetration. the two were lost and inexperienced on how to use their bodies. but, I believe their love has already been consummated. the earthly penetration 
         is just an add-on. i do believe that before their flesh had the chance to plod around earth's clod, somewhere in the ether, their spirits had made passionate love to mark one another. simply to ensure they 
         would find each other amidst humanity's madness.</p>
    
    
    <p style= color:fuchsia>that night, however, when the effort turned out futile, the boy was a bit upset. the two took a 2am stroll to have a smoke and contemplate their perceived shortcomings. upon returning to the house, the boy waited for 
        the girl to crawl back into his bed. the girl was a bit slothful in how she took her time to wind down; because of this, he thought she would not return to him since he believed he failed to bring forth their love 
        from the metaphysical. but of course, she returned. her love does not die, nor wane, or behave unscrupulously. the love within is not built on worldly things but rather the unseen. one must remember 
        that the foundation to all good things is faith and trust. how could she not have returned to him when she recognized back in 
         october, and again in january, an undying attraction, and how sweetly he had reciprocated before she ever caught on? That night they slept side by side. skin to skin.</p>
